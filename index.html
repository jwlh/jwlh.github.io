						<h2>Profile</h2>

            <p>I’m a recent graduate from General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course.</p>
            <p>Previously I had a successful career as a Senior TV Producer, working at many of the top London agencies. This has given me a great background in organising and managing processes and teams of people, whilst also nurturing creativity.  Whilst this was really enjoyable I came to realise it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I wanted to find my passion and after much thought and investigation, I found the world of coding.  </p>
            <p>I’ve always been interested in technology as a whole, the tech behind film and special effects was my main interest and the bit of my job I really loved above all others. Marrying that with the very logical side to my personality (which led me to be a producer in the first place) and my love of logic-based puzzles and challenges led me to coding as an opportunity to apply that, along with the creativity that I also enjoyed in TV Production on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>Obviously, I’ve only just scratched the surface of development and I’m looking to find a team in which I can really grow as a developer.  There is so much out there that I would love to learn and expand on the great foundation I have built here at GA.</p>

                <p>
                  Over 15 years of working my way up through the Advertising TV Production world I’ve developed a wide range of transferable skills.  From building a tower of vehicles on a runway in South Africa to organising a car chase through the streets of Vancouver via a family of alien puppets and celebrities like Idris Elba and Bill Nighy, every production has taught me something new. </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Video Editing:</strong> On programs such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Avid & Final Cut and also simple animation and the like using Adobe After Effects.<br/>
                  <strong>Organisation:</strong> As a TV Producer, I was in charge of scheduling, budgeting and managing the delivery of multi-million pound TV Commercials filmed all over the world.<br/>
                  <strong>Teamwork:</strong> Again whilst working as a TV Producer I worked alongside creatives and account teams, quite often as the middleman between the two who often had differing views on what they wanted out of a project and how to achieve it!<br/>
                  <strong>Presentations:</strong> Also as part of my role, I would lead organisational and planning meetings as well as presentations of work in progress with senior partners and clients.<br/>
